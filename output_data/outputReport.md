Debiteurnaam --> Cust. name
Factuurnummer --> Belegnummer
Datum --> Belegdatum
Bedrag_EUR --> Betrag in Hauswährung

The expected output would be:

Cust. name, Belegnummer, Belegdatum, Betrag in Hauswährung

The dataset columns that correspond to the set of columns given are the ones listed above.

I arrived at this conclusion by analyzing the dataset and looking at the values in each column. By comparing the values in the set of columns to the values in the dataset columns, it was clear that these were the columns that corresponded to each other. 

For example, the "Debiteurnaam" column in the set of columns maps to the "Cust. name" column in the dataset. This is because the values in the "Debiteurnaam" column contain customer names, and the "Cust. name" column in the dataset also contains customer names.

Similarly, the "Factuurnummer" column in the set of columns maps to the "Belegnummer" column in the dataset because the values in both columns represent invoice numbers.

The "Datum" column in the set of columns maps to the "Belegdatum" column in the dataset because the values in both columns represent dates.

Finally, the "Bedrag_EUR" column in the set of columns maps to the "Betrag in Hauswährung" column in the dataset because both columns contain values in Euros.

By matching the columns in the set to the corresponding columns in the dataset, we can see which values in the dataset correspond to each of the columns in the set. This information can be used to perform further analysis on the dataset, such as aggregating the values by customer or by date, or to prepare the dataset for further processing in a different system.
